When I visited UToledo, I met a professor who showed me all the opportunities I would have as a freshman. And I had more than I thought I would. I called nine football games, including the MAC championship for UToledo's radio station, WXUT. I called softball and baseball games on ESPN. I was able to get my experience from day one and I havenâ€™t stopped."</p>
