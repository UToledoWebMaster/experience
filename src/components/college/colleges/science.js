I wanted a university that was big, so I could make a lot of friends and participate in many organizations, but also not too big, so I could have one-to-one interaction with my professors and the ability to make an impact. A good scholarship was my third criterion. UToledo met all my criteria! And it's close to Cedar Point amusement park, another plus!"</p>
